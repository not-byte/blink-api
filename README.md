# BLINK

The Blink project üëÄ is a Decentralized Communicator, that aims to leverage [WEB3 technology](#web3) and provide easy
access and
communication with people around the world üó∫Ô∏è Written in [Rust
ü¶Ä](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust), [Vue.js+TS](https://github.com/vuejs/core), [Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia)
üçç
and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) üçÉ with the [Dfinity
CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) for compiling.

### About

The goal is to create innovative solutions in digital services, data security, scalability, and
interoperability.

<p id="web3"></p>
Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts
such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.

Our challenge is to develop a canister on the Internet Computer that addresses one or more problems
described in the
contest project. We have chosen to create a DApp with a communication system.

### Requirements (Met!)

- [x] A public project on GitHub with complete code
- [x] A detailed project description in the README file
- [x] A short presentation of the idea (maximum 3 minutes)

### Version

First release 1.0.0-BETA

> [!Caution]
> Project is still under a development

If you encounter any bugs or errors, create an issue and head to the [Security section](#security)

### How to use it?

Simply navigate to [BLINK](https://blink.notbyte.com), create a blockchain identity, and you're done! Sending messages
is as easy as in any other communicator like Messenger or WhatsApp!

### Secure Messaging

Send and receive encrypted messages ensuring your communication is private and secure.

### Decentralized System

Built on the ICP blockchain to ensure secure and reliable communication. Utilizes smart contracts (canisters) for
seamless operation.

### User-Friendly UI

Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless user experience.

### Open Source

Project is available on GitHub with full source code for transparency and community collab.

<p id="technologies"></p>

![Technologies](./.github/readme/technologies.svg)
![Icons](./.github/readme/icons.svg)

For our backend service we have chosen **Rust** ü¶Ä as Message provider with it‚Äôs memory safety and blazingly fast üöÄ
computing.

In creating interface **TypeScript** and **Vue.js** helped us the most, with addition of TailwindCSS for styling and
Vite,
Docker for deployment, so we can launch our project to at any time!

<p id="setup"></p>

![Project setup](./.github/readme/setup.svg)

### Development

To start a local canister execution environment and web server processes use `dfx start`, that enables
you to deploy canisters to the local canister execution environment to test your DApps during development.

```sh
dfx start
```

### Deployment

Use the dfx deploy command to register, build, and deploy a dapp on the local canister execution environment, on the IC
or on a specified testnet. By default, all canisters defined in the project `dfx.json` configuration file are deployed.

```sh
dfx deploy
```

<p id="interface"></p>

### [Messages](./src/views/ChatsView.vue)

This section provides features to search for users, view currently online users, and browse through recent open
chats.

### [Chat](./src/views/ChatView.vue)

Here, the entire application process takes place, including the exchange of messages and images.

### [Discover](./src/views/DiscoverView.vue)

This section allows users to find new people that want to communicate.

> [!WARNING]
> Work-in-progress Feature

### [Settings](./src/views/SettingsView.vue)

This option enables users to personalize the application's appearance and behavior to suit their daily usage
preferences and needs.

### Storage

Because blockchain is immutable by default we need to ensure data integrity during contract upgrades by using stable
storage. This also allows to reliably save data on the blockchain. Ensures that the contract can always be brought back
to a known good state.
